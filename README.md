## About:

Quarrel is a platform where arguments are come to an end. Two people face off in an attempt to solve their argument once and for all. Do you have a spouse who you claim never to do the dishes and when you bring it up they claim that you're the one never doing the dishes? Usually on the internet we just hear one-sided stories "my spouse/friend never does this and always does this, bla bla" - with Quarrel you get both sides of the story. Other users are able to like, to choose who's right, as well as offer advice/comment.

## Strategy

## Design

### Planning

I wireframed it using Balsamiq:

![wireframe](media/images/readme-images/readme-landing-page-mobile.png)

![wireframe](media/images/readme-images/readme-landing-page-mobile.png)

![wireframe](media/images/readme-images/readme-post-detail-page.png)

The only thing that strayed from the initial wireframe was the addition of the two themes.

### Fonts

font-family: "Roboto", sans-serif (The rest)
font-family: "Alfa Slab One" (H1/H2)

The issues portrayed I deemed not needing a fix, considering the "defined but never used" is functions being called in the html-document.
